This study focuses on generating synthetic mobile traffic data using various features derived from areal data in the cities of Paris, Lyon, and Marseille.
Relevant tasks to achieve this goal are the selection of relevant features and the exploration of the relationship between urban areas and mobile data traffic data. 
Machine learning models are implemented to generate the time series of traffic data and feature importance methods are implemented to understand which features are most relevant. 
The proposed analysis holds potential for various applications, such as urban planning, infrastructure optimization, and simulating the impact of policy and infrastructure changes on mobile data usage in urban environments.
