# Thesis: "Generation of Mobile Traffic Data"

This study focuses on generating synthetic mobile traffic data using various features derived from areal data in the cities of Paris, Lyon, and Marseille.
Relevant tasks to achieve this goal are the selection of relevant features and the exploration of the relationship between urban areas and mobile data traffic data. 
Machine learning models are implemented to generate the time series of traffic data and feature importance methods are implemented to understand which features are most relevant. 
The proposed analysis holds potential for various applications, such as urban planning, infrastructure optimization, and simulating the impact of policy and infrastructure changes on mobile data usage in urban environments.

Based on the NetMob2023 challenge and dataset [1], the research questions addressed in this thesis are:
- Is it possible to generate a synthetic time series of mobile traffic data consumption for a specific area of a city, given certain geographic and demographic features and the possibility to train on actual traffic data available for other areas of the same city?
- Which features are relevant for this purpose? Furthermore, can the model trained in one city be extended to predict the time series of mobile traffic data in another city?
- Finally, are all the categories of mobile applications (social networks, gaming,..) for which the time series of mobile traffic data is available similarly predictable?
